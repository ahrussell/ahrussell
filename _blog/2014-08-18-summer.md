###199B 2nd Street: A Summer at a SV Startup
________________

After a summer of writing and thinking in code, it feels strange not to see these words wrapped up in some sort of a `print` function call.  It's been entirely too long since I've sought to reorder and express my thoughts outside of a primarily logical context.  This summer I lived and breathed code.  From regular perusals of Hacker News, working at the office or at home, starting a number of personal projects, learning Haskell in the late hours of the evening, and the BART rides filled with abstract algebra or number theory notes.  So in some sense, the "what I learned this summer" show-and-tell exercise is pretty straightforward; and though I learned an incredible amount, this list could be enumerated fairly quickly.

As of yesterday, I arrived in the human oven known as Phoenix.And as I began to think about this post, I lamented.  What had *I* truly gained from this summer - this special three months where "real life" is put on hold and 

As with many summer vacations, it's difficult to realize the amount of time that's passed until it's all over.
